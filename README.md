  CAESAR CIPHER IMPLEMENTATION üîê

  I developed a Caesar Cipher implementation using Python language. This program allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.



 What I Did:

‚úÖ Implemented both encryption and decryption functions.

‚úÖ Allowed users to set a custom shift value.

‚úÖ Ensured proper handling of uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters.





üîé Key Learning Outcomes:

‚û§ Understanding classical encryption techniques.

‚û§ Python string manipulation and character encoding.

‚û§ The importance of cryptographic security in real-world applications.
